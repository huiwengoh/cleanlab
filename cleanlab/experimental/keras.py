"""
A wrapper class you can use to make any Keras model compatible with cleanlab and sklearn.
Most of the instance methods of this class are the same as the ones for any Keras model, 
see the Keras documentation for details.

This is a good example of making any bespoke neural network compatible with cleanlab.

You must have Tensorflow installed: https://www.tensorflow.org/install

Note: Tensorflow is only compatible with Python versions >= 3.7: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#software_requirements

Tips:
* If this class lacks certain functionality, you can alternatively try scikeras: https://github.com/adriangb/scikeras 
* To call ``fit()`` on a Tensorflow Dataset object with a Keras model, the Dataset should already be batched.
